  Ethereum networks.

# GoodDollar: Ethereum â†” Ecrox

## Architecture Overview

This bridge is two layer bridge. In the base level the  Arbitrary Message Bridge \(AMB\) is responsible for relaying messages between the networks. On top of the AMB,  the pluggable mediators implement a contract logic of token relaying of various assets.

## How to use

Any ECROX20 token can be bridged for Ethereum to the Ecrox. If the token is relayed for the first time. A bridged token, paired with the original token, will be created on the Ecrox network. 

To send token from the Ethereum network:

1. Approve the ECROX20 tokens to be spent by the Foreign ECROX20 bridge. 
2. Call relayTokens function on the bridge contract

the `relayTokens` method will lock the ECROX20 tokens on the foreign bridge. After a couple of confirmations, an equal amount of the Ecrox ECROX20 token will be sent from the home bridge contract.

To send tokens from Ecrox network

1. Approve the ECROX20 tokens to be spent by the Home ECROX20 bridge. 
2. Call `relayTokens` function on the bridge contract

the `relayTokens` method will lock the bridged tokens on the home bridge. Then, an equal amount of the paired ECROX20 token will be sent from the foreign bridge contract.
