# Ecrox Assembly

Ecrox Assembly is a governance body formed from particularly active members of the Ecrox community. Its formation is the first step in transitioning full governance and ownership over the Ecrox platform to the community.  

Currently, Ecrox Assembly consists of five Ecrox ecosystem members independent from Ecrox Foundation who have shown consistent dedication and commitment to the project, and already have a voice within the community.

Ecrox Assembly's **current role includes the following**: 

* taking over the control over the [Ecrox Forum](https://forum.ecroxscan.com/) community discussion platform;
* implementing the Snapshot voting mechanism on Ecrox; and
* managing the Community Token Pool.

## Community Token Pool

Ecrox Assembly's budget will be initially constituted by the **Community Token Pool**. Each month, **200,000 ECROX** will be allocated to it from the Ecrox Bootstrap Pool \(discussed [here](https://docs.ecroxscan.com/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)\).

Ecrox Assembly will regularly distribute the Community Token Pool funds to finance grants, bounties, marketing, and other initiatives designed to serve communities building on the platform and drive innovation.
