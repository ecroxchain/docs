# Grants and Bounties

Since the inception of Ecrox, our core team has been dedicated to fostering the growth of the Ecrox blockchain and creating a suite of tools to empower developers in building highly user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps). Our primary focus has been on nurturing payment-centric communities such as GoodDollar, Kolektivo, Comunitaria, and PeeplEat.

Now, we are eager to expand the reach of our tools and support even more high-quality projects. To achieve this goal, we are excited to announce the Ecrox Grants program, designed to provide funding to deserving applicants who contribute value to the Ecrox ecosystem and its users.

The Ecrox Future Dev Pool will be utilized to back projects that align with our vision. We are particularly interested in supporting initiatives focused on:

1. New high-potential payment-centric communities.
2. DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) initiatives.
3. Applications tailored for new crypto users.
4. NFT (Non-Fungible Token) projects.
5. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications.
6. Projects that complement or enhance existing Ecrox projects.
7. Innovative ideas and categories that bring novel perspectives to the ecosystem.

While the grant process is flexible and subject to updates, we typically announce bounties periodically based on specific project categories. Please refer to the next page to view the currently available bounties.

Candidates for Ecrox Grants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* Strength of the team, assessed through platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn.
* Clear and concise project description that articulates the value proposition effectively.
* Technical and product quality, considering any existing work or product roadmap vision.

We welcome submissions from passionate individuals and teams who are ready to make a positive impact in the blockchain space. Click here to apply and be a part of the Ecrox Grants program.
