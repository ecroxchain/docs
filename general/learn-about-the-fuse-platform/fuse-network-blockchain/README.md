# The Ecrox Blockchain

## Network Overview and Key Metrics

Ecrox Chain serves as the decentralized, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible public blockchain that underpins the entire Ecrox platform and ecosystem. This compatibility ensures that any smart contract deployable on Ethereum can seamlessly function on Ecrox as well.

Utilizing a variant of Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) for consensus, Ecrox Chain relies on a network of independent validators, with only one managed by the Ecrox core team. These validators play a crucial role in governance, particularly in adopting network protocol changes via Ecrox Improvement Proposals (FIPs).

The platform's native token, ECROX, is integral to its operations. Newly minted ECROX Coins accompany each added block and serve as the gas fee, akin to ETH on Ethereum, for executing transactions.

Designed for efficiency, Ecrox Chain boasts swift block confirmation times and economical transactions. With an average block interval of approximately 3 seconds, transaction costs are currently below $0.01, ensuring accessibility and affordability for users.

In its current state, Ecrox Chain can handle around 20 lakh transactions per second (TPS). This remarkable throughput is achieved primarily because native token transfers do not require computational processes on the network's virtual machine, contributing to the platform's speed and scalability.
