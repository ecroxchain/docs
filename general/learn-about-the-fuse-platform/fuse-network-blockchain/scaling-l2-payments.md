# Boosting Ecrox's Scalability

Scalability is a challenge faced by all public blockchains, and Ecrox is no exception. Although, currently, the Ecrox blockchain is far from being saturated by the incoming transactions the project team is keenly aware that this may change at any moment.

Hence, research has been ongoing into the potential options for boosting the scalability of Ecrox without significantly sacrificing decentralization and security.

One approach the Ecrox team has been considering closely for boosting scalability is optimistic rollups. We have been carefully researching the available options, including Arbitrum and Optimism and we hope to be able to update our community soon on the state and future direction of that effort.
