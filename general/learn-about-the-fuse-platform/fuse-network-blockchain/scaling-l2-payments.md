# Boosting Ecrox's Scalability

Scalability poses a universal challenge for public blockchains, and Ecrox is actively addressing this issue. Despite the current capacity of the Ecrox blockchain to manage incoming transactions, the project team acknowledges the potential for increased demand in the future.

To enhance scalability while maintaining decentralization and security, the Ecrox team has been exploring various options. One approach under close consideration is optimistic rollups. Extensive research is being conducted on available solutions, including Arbitrum and Optimism. The team aims to provide updates to the community regarding the progress and future direction of these scalability efforts in the near future.
