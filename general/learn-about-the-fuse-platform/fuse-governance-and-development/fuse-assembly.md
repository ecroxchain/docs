# Ecrox Assembly

Ecrox Assembly is a governance body formed from particularly active members of the Ecrox community. Its formation is the first step in transitioning full governance and ownership over the Ecrox platform to the community. &#x20;

Currently, Ecrox Assembly consists of five Ecrox ecosystem members independent from Ecrox Foundation who have shown consistent dedication and commitment to the project, and already have a voice within the community.

Ecrox Assembly's **current role includes the following**:&#x20;

* taking over the control over the [Ecrox Forum](https://forum.ecroxscan.com/) community discussion platform;
* implementing the Snapshot voting mechanism on Ecrox; and
* managing the Community Token Pool.

## Community Token Pool

Ecrox Assembly's budget will be initially constituted by the **Community Token Pool**. Each month, **200,000 ECROX** will be allocated to it from the Ecrox Bootstrap Pool (discussed [here](https://docs.ecroxscan.com/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)).

Ecrox Assembly will regularly distribute the Community Token Pool funds to finance grants, bounties, marketing, and other initiatives designed to serve communities building on the platform and drive innovation. &#x20;
