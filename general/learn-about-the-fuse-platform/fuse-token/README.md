# Ecrox Token (ECROX)

The ECROX token is the native currency of the Ecrox blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## ECROX utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Ecrox blockchain, ECROX is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Ecrox to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.ecroxscan.com/](https://status.ecroxscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked ECROX. Which means validators with higher amounts of Ecrox staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any ECROX holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of ECROX they wish. They receive a share of the Ecrox block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As ECROX is the native currency on Ecrox, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, ECROX transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of ECROX tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Ecrox platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
