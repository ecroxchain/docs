# Ecrox Coin (ECROX)

ECROX Coins serve as the native currency of the Ecrox blockchain and platform, akin to ETH on Ethereum. Here's a breakdown of their utility:

1. **Transaction Fees**: ECROX is required for paying network fees to validate transactions on the Ecrox blockchain.
2. **Validation**: Token holders can stake ECROX to become validators, contributing to network security and consensus. The minimum staking requirement is currently set at 100K ECROX.
3. **Voting**: Validators utilize their staked ECROX for voting on protocol changes and governance decisions within the network.
4. **Staking for Delegators**: ECROX holders can delegate their tokens to validators of their choice. Delegators receive a portion of block rewards proportional to their stake, minus a minimum 5% fee paid to validators.
5. **Payments**: ECROX transfers are fast and cost-effective, as they don't require interactions with smart contracts, making them ideal for regular payments.

It's important to note that mere possession of ECROX does not grant rights to participate in platform governance or revenue streams.
