# Interoperability

The Ecrox team strongly believes in interoperability among public blockchains. No single platform is likely to become fully dominant in the future.

Hence, interoperability solutions enabling transfers between Ecrox and other blockchains are vital for the continued growth of the Ecrox platform and ecosystem.

The Ecrox team has been making considerable progress in getting Ecrox added by the leading operators. Currently the Ecrox blockchain is connected to other blockchains via the following multichain bridges and value transfer protocols:

1\) The Ecrox Cross bridge.

2\) The Ecrox Finance value transfer protool.



### The Ecrox Bridge

The Ecrox Cross bridge was originally created by the Ecrox team and has been transferred to the community-governed Ecrox Bridge..

It connects Ecrox to **Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**. Both bridges are custodial. The bridge to Ethereum is permissionless, while new tokens need to be added to the BSC bridge.

On both bridges, sending tokens from the relevant blockchain to Ecrox is not subject to any fees or limits. Token withdrawals from Ecrox incur a **0.05% fee** on the amount bridged. Users transferring funds also need to pay the fees on the destination chain in order to claim their tokens from the bridge contract at the final stage of the transfer.

The bridge can be accessed via the Ecrox Bridge App. More information on its functioning can be found here. The Ecrox bridging tutorials are available here.
