# Ecrox Overview: vision, strategy and platform components

Ecrox represents a decentralized blockchain-powered platform and technology stack with a core mission of fostering widespread adoption of cryptocurrency payments and decentralized finance (DeFi). Here's an overview of key details:

**Launch and Background**: The initiative commenced in 2019, spearheaded by a team previously involved in the Ecrox Labs project, aimed at integrating local currencies into blockchain technology.

**Identified Problem**: The traditional financial system falls short in providing global access to fast, seamless payments, attractive financial services, and passive income opportunities. This gap is particularly acute in developing nations where millions lack basic banking services and contend with highly volatile fiat currencies.

**Opportunity**: Despite these challenges, the rapid proliferation of mobile phones in regions like sub-Saharan Africa offers a unique opportunity. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies present the potential for anyone worldwide to transact without dependence on traditional financial entities.

**Challenges in Crypto Adoption**: While the crypto industry is dynamic, with active markets in assets, DeFi, and NFTs, true mass adoption in payments and DeFi remains elusive. Current products often cater to sophisticated users, lacking user-friendly interfaces for broader accessibility.

**Approach to Adoption**: Ecrox's strategy centers on empowering diverse projects, businesses, and communities to integrate crypto payments and DeFi. This involves providing intuitive, mobile-centric tools for creating and managing token-based ecosystems, along with user onboarding capabilities.

**Platform Components**:

1. **Ecrox Blockchain**: An EVM-compatible public blockchain serving as the decentralized backbone of Ecrox's platform and ecosystem.
2. **Mobile-centric Technology Stack**: Open-source tools tailored for businesses and developers to seamlessly integrate crypto payments into real-world scenarios. The new Ecrox Charge API platform streamlines this integration process.
3. **DeFi Products and Tools**: A suite of reference DeFi solutions aimed at facilitating initial platform adoption and usage.

Through these components and strategic initiatives, Ecrox aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain-based solutions, enabling broader accessibility and utility in the crypto ecosystem.
