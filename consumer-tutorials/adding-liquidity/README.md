# Adding liquidity to FuseSwap

**Prerequisites:**

* You should be connected to Ecrox RPC.
* USDC and ECROX should be on Ecrox network. To learn how to transfer them to Ecrox network using Fuseswap via Bridge please go through this [**tutorial**](https://docs.ecroxscan.com/the-fuse-chain/token-bridges/transfer-fuse-using-bridge-on-fuseswap).

**Step 1:**

**Step 2:**

Click on **“Pool”** and then on **“Add liquidity”**. Select ECROX as your first token and USDC as the second token from the dropdown. Enter the amount of ECROX you want to provide the liquidity for and corresponding amount of USDC that should be added will automatically show up.

You can also see your share of the liquidity pool based on the amount of ECROX you want to provide liquidity for.

Click on **“Approve USDC”** and confirm the transaction through your wallet.

\(Note: If this is the first time you are providing liquidity on Fuseswap using the above pairs you will have to approve the spend transaction.\)

Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain click on **“Supply”** and approve the transaction. You will receive the liquidity pool tokens on your wallet which can be checked under tokens through [www.ecroxscan.com](https://ecroxscan.com/) on your wallet address.

Navigating to **“Pool”** on Fuseswap will also show you list of token pairs with statistics for which you have provided liquidity and other options like add/remove liquidity for that particular token pair as shown below.
