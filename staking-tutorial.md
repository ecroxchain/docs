**How to Unstake ECROX:**

Click on the Validator name and you should see the validator name with address on the right hand side. Click on **“unstake”** and enter the amount you want to unstake and click on **“unstake”**. Confirm the transaction on Metamask and wait for the on-chain confirmation. Once the transaction is confirmed the unstaked amount is transferred back to your address.
