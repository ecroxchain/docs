# Contracts Overview

Consensus plays a crucial role in blockchain systems by ensuring agreement on the network's single state. In the Ecrox network, we utilize a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus model, a variant of the Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: In PoS, a group of validators is responsible for maintaining and validating the network's state. Validators take turns updating the state, with each validator having its designated slot in the rotation. When it's their turn, a validator updates the network's state, and other validators verify the update for validity.
2. **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: DPoS introduces a delegation system where token holders can delegate their tokens to specific validators. These elected validators then perform the network validation tasks. DPoS aims to enhance scalability and efficiency by reducing the number of validators actively participating in the consensus process.

In the Ecrox network, DPoS ensures fault tolerance and efficient agreement on the network's state, contributing to the overall reliability and performance of the blockchain ecosystem.
