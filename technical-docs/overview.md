# White label wallet

The Ecrox wallet is a cross platform \(for iOS and Android\) Ethereum wallet written in Dart and built on [Flutter](http://https//flutter.dev/). It's running on to the Ecrox network, but can be plugged into any EVM compatible blockchain.

The app interacts with the Ethereum network and the Ecrox chain. The user stores his wallet in the operating system secured storage. Transactions are signed with the private key which is encrypted locally on the device by the user. All the data is controlled by the user and shared on demand with 3rd party services using web3.0 interfaces. Private user data is stored also in a decentralized manner via 3box and IPFS protocol in order to be able to share it or restore it. Ecrox wallet is meant to be used with the Ecrox Studio and can integrate any ERC-20 token by changing the default contract address.
